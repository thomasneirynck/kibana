=== Phantom Error when Generating Reports
If report generation fails with the error "Phantom immediately exited with: 127",
install the required `libfontconfig` and `libfreetype6` packages.

=== Text is Not Rendered Correctly in Generated Reports

If report labels are rendered as empty rectangles, there are no system fonts
available. Install at least one font package on the system.
